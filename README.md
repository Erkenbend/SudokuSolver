# SudokuSolver

This projects solves any valid Sudoku grid, using backtracking to make guesses when stuck.

The untouched original version from October 2016 can be found under the "old" directory. It works correctly and fast enough, although not the prettiest code in hindsight.

Now in 2022, my goal is to use the 6 years of programming experience I have accumulated since then to provide an updated version under the "new" directory.
